The computer used by the student must have a unix shell, and an i586-elf
cross toolchain installed and added to $PATH.

In addition, GNU make, Qemu-system-i386 and git must be installed.

Machine queue is recommended to let the student try to run the WEK
OS once on a real machine, but it's not required.
